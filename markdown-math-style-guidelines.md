# 1. Markdown math style guidelines

## 1.1. Reusable terms

### 1.1.1. Statements and expressions

A **statement** refers to a piece of content, such as, but not limited to:
- Markdown heading
- One plain text sentence, or a sequence of such sentences
- Plain text sentence with incorporated MathJax inline expressions `$ ... $`
- One MathJax block expression `$$ ... $$`

MathJax blocks may be incorporated into statements, but they must be presented at the end of the statement.

MathJax inline expressions `$ ... $` may be incorporated into any part of the statement.

An **expression** is a logically and syntactically separate piece of a statement. Each statement consists of one or more expressions.

Some statements are *explicitly* defined in this prompt to be **complex statements**. They are composed of multiple sub-statements, each of which is considered a separate statement.

### 1.1.2. Plain text prose

**Plain text expressions**, **words**, or **wording** refer to plain text prose that is not part of MathJax or Markdown expressions or commands.

### 1.1.3. Math symbols

**Math symbols** refer to any sequences of characters representing mathematical notation, primarily with MathJax. This includes, but is not limited to:
- `$ \mathbb{C} $` for complex numbers
- `$ \mathbb{R} $` for real numbers
- `$ \forall $` for "for all"
- `$ \exist $` for "there exists"
- `$ \in $` for "is an element of"
- `$ \subseteq $` for "is a subset of"
- `$ \{ .. \} $` for a set notation
- `$ : $` for "such that"
- `$ \quad $` for quad space
- `$ \ $` for space
- `$ \implies $` for "implies"
- `$ \iff $` for "if and only if"
- `$ , $` for "and" or "as well as"

### 1.1.4. Math symbols surrogates

**Math symbols surrogates** refer to any short and descriptive plain text prose representation of a mathematical concept that is well-known but either lacks its own notation or is too complex for concise symbolic expression. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Differentiability
- Continuity
- Vector space being a subspace of another vector space

Incorporate them into math symbolic expressions using the following format: `$ \text{} $`. For example:
- `$ \text{is differentiable} $`
- `$ \text{is continuous} $`
- `$ \text{is a subspace of} $`

Consider the `$ \text{} $` format as proper mathematical notation.

### 1.1.5. Headings

Headings are Markdown heading [statements](#111-statements-and-expressions) that indicate the structure of the document.

## 1.2. Syntax and semantics

### 1.2.1. Newlines

Distinguish between rendered newlines and source code newlines. If not directly specified, newlines refer to source code newlines.

Put double newlines after every statement, except at the end of the document where a single newline should be used.

Put a single newline before a MathJax block if it is part of a statement and appears at the end of it.

If the rendered output of a MathJax block is too wide to fit the screen, split it into multiple lines using `\\` or similar rendered newline expressions. This rule may be applied near symbols such as, but not limited to:
- after `$ : \\ $`
- after `$ , \\ $`
- before `$ \\ = $ `, or `$ \\ &= $`
- after the logical end of an expression

Special notation, such as `\begin{aligned} .. \end{aligned}`, may be used for better readability. Judge based on the context. A frequent scenario might involve long equations where the first and last lines are short and represent the essence of the equation.

If either the source code of a MathJax block is too wide to fit the screen or it already contains `\\` or similar rendered newline expressions, split it into multiple lines using single newlines near special symbols, such as, but not limited to:
- after `$$`
- after `\\`
- after `:`, `: \quad`, `: \ `
- after `, `, `, \quad`, `, \ `
- after `\begin{...}` and before `\end{...}`
- after the last line of the MathJax block
- before `$$` if it is part of a statement at the end of it

If the source code of one [statement](#111-statements-and-expressions) consists of more than 7 lines, replace single newlines with double newlines inside it.

### 1.2.2. Spacing and indentation

Use tabs for indentation.

Place spaces inside MathJax inline expressions between `$` and the expression itself.

Place spaces inside MathJax block expressions between `$$` and the expression itself, if newline rules are not applied.

Place spaces between MathJax symbols.

Use rendered MathJax symbols for spacing to improve readability between mathematical symbols and the rest of the expression. This may include, but is not limited to:
- `$ \exist \ $`
- `$ \forall \, $`
- `$ : \quad $`
- `$ , \quad $`

For certain mathematical terms, such as, but not limited to, the imaginary unit `$ i $`, use `$ \, $` between the unit and the rest of the expression in operations involving it.

### 1.2.3. Punctuation

Do not put dots after MathJax blocks.

Do not put dots after Markdown headings.

Use special punctuation symbols to separate logically independent parts of long MathJax block expressions. This may include, but is not limited to:
- `$ : $` with the meaning "such that", "then", or "therefore"
- `$ , $` with the meaning "and" or "as well as"

### 1.2.4. Capitalization

Never capitalize words after the first word in a statement, except for proper nouns or words that are always capitalized, such as, but not limited to:
- People's names
- Names of theorems

### 1.2.5. Details section

Use details sections to hide proofs of theorems, solutions of exercises or tasks, explanations, etc.

```markdown

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

... (one or more internal sub statements) ...

</details>

```

Consider a details section as a complex statement. The internals of the details section consist of one or more internal sub-statements.

Possible details summary titles include, but are not limited to:
- Proof
- Solution

### 1.2.6. Ellipsis

Use an ellipsis `...` to indicate that content in a sequence of elements is omitted.

## 1.3. Compactness and declarative presentation

### 1.3.1. Compact expressions and statements

Avoid plain text prose wherever possible. Use math symbols, surrogates, MathJax inline and block expressions instead.

A few words may be used at the beginning of a statement, or within it if they are absolutely necessary.

An ideal compact statement consists of no words or very few words at the beginning, and a MathJax block expression encompassing multiple interconnected expressions at the end.

### 1.3.2. Compact document

Reduce the size and quantity of statements as much as possible.

Merge statements if they are closely related and can be expressed in a single statement. Reiterate and merge as many statements as possible.

Put key ideas, milestones, theorem and task declarations, results, and final answers as standalone statements within MathJax block expressions.

### 1.3.3. Declarative statements and expressions

Avoid imperative statements, expressions, and wording. The "imperative" usually conveys actions, commands, or instructions.

An expression like "[Action] the [Result]" is less preferable than "[Result]". This may include, but is not limited to:
- "[Prove] the [Theorem]" => "[Theorem]"
- "[Show] that [Property] holds" => "[Property]"
- "[Verify] the [Equality]" => "[Equality]"
- "[Explain] the [Result]" => "[Result]"

The actual proof, solution, or explanation is or will be declared in the details section.

However, imperative commands may be unavoidable when the final expression is not yet known, must remain hidden in the details section, or is extremely long, spanning multiple statements that are hard to merge. In such cases, "[Action] the [Result]" should still be rephrased to be as short as possible. This may include, but is not limited to:
- "[Find] the solution for [Equation]" => "Solve [Equation]"
- "[Find] the [Variables] when [Expression] is true" => "Solve for [Variables]: [Expression]"
- "[Verify] if the [Property] holds" => "Verify [Property]"

Some imperative commands might appear declarative but must still be avoided. This may include, but is not limited to:
- "[Proof] of the [Theorem]" => "[Theorem]"
- "[Verification] of the [Property]" => "[Property]"

## 1.4. Common types of statements

This section describes only the most common types of statements. It is not exhaustive and does not cover all possible cases.

Evolve new types of statements, modify existing ones, and change wording, punctuation, spacing, newlines, and formatting according to the context and these style guidelines.

### 1.4.1. Definitions

Statements of this type introduce either a new concept or reference well-known ones.

Express references to well-known concepts using the following structures:
- "[Notation] [Short-description]: [Core-definition]"
- "[Notation] [Short-description]"
- "[Short-description]: [Core-definition]"

Express definitions of new concepts using the following structures:
- "Define [Notation] [Short-description]: [Core-definition]"
- "Define [Notation]: [Core-definition]"
- "[Short-description]: [Core-definition]"

"[Notation]" is a symbolic representation of the concept using a MathJax inline expression.

"[Short-description]" is a short plain text expression naming or framing the concept.

"[Core-definition]" is a formal definition of the concept using a MathJax block expression. It may consist of set builder notation, declaring the set of objects along with their properties, representation, and possible operations.

Omit "[Core-definition]" for well-known concepts based on the context. For example, when key properties are not relevant and unlikely to be referenced.

### 1.4.2. Variables declarations

Statements of this type introduce variables â€“ symbolic representations of mathematical objects of interest. Variables may represent auxiliary, intermediate, preconditioned, or scope-specific objects.

Declare variables using the following structures:
- "Let [Notation]: [Core-definition]"
- "Let [Core-definition]"
- "Set [Core-definition]"
- "[Core-definition]"

"[Notation]" and "[Core-definition]" are the same as in the [Definitions](#141-definitions) section, except they are less general and thus more tied to the context.

"[Core-definition]", in the case of variables, may be represented by a MathJax inline expression if it is very short and simple, such as, but not limited to:
- `$ a = value $`
- `$ a, b \in S $`
- `$ \forall c, d \in S $`
- `$ \exists e \in S $`
- `$ U \subseteq V $`

If "[Core-definition]" contains multiple interconnected expressions, use a MathJax block expression.

### 1.4.3. Derivations

Derivations are statements that encapsulate the process of deriving new knowledge from existing statements.

Each derivation statement should contain ideas that are closely interconnected and logically follow each other. Each derivation step should clearly show how the next step follows from the previous ones.

Most frequently, derivations are the statements that may contain some imperative wording.

Derivations should be given lower priority with regard to the merging strategy described in [Section 2.3.2.](#232-compact-document).

Derivations are expressed using the following structures:
- "[Linker] [Core-derivation]"
- "[Short-description] [Core-derivation]"
- "[Long-description]"

"[Core-derivation]" is a formal derivation of the concept using a MathJax block expression.

"[Linker]" is a short phrase connecting previous and immediate results with the current one. It may include, but is not limited to:
- "Thus,"
- "Therefore,"
- "Hence,"
- "As a result"
- "This leads to:"
- "From the previous statement follows:"

"[Short-description]" is a short plain text expression acting as a bridge between other statements and the core derivation itself. It may contain references to particular statements or concepts, as well as very short and clear explanations of the ideas behind the derivation.

"[Long-description]" is a longer and significantly more verbose version of "[Short-description]" combined with the derivation itself being described using plain text prose and math symbols. It should be preferred only if it is impossible to represent the derivation in a MathJax block expression of "[Core-derivation]".

### 1.4.4. Theorems

This is a more general term encompassing theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and other similar statements.

Consider a theorem as a complex statement consisting of a sequence of:
1. "[Definitions](#241-definitions)"
2. "[Variable-declarations](#242-variables-declarations)"
3. "[Theorem-declaration]"
4. "[Proof]"

"[Definitions]" consists of [Definitions](#241-definitions) statements. "[Variable-declarations]" consists of [Variables declarations](#242-variables-declarations) statements.

"[Theorem-declaration]" is a statement that is expressed using the following structures:
- "[Short-description]: [Core-theorem]"
- "[Core-theorem]"
- "Then [Core-theorem]", if "[Definitions]" and "[Variable-declarations]" have been introduced

"[Core-theorem]" is a formal expression of the theorem using a MathJax block expression. It may consist of a series of sub-expressions connected with punctuation or operators, such as, but not limited to:
- `$ , $`
- `$ : $`
- `$ \implies $`
- `$ \iff $`

"[Short-description]" is a short plain text expression naming or framing the theorem. It may also contain a short explanation of the essence of the theorem and an inline version of variable definitions if "[Core-theorem]" is too long and complex to include them.

"[Proof]" of a theorem is a statement that is expressed using a details section. A proof consists of one or more internal statements such as variable declarations, derivations, and possibly other types of statements.

### 1.4.5. Tasks

Tasks are statements that represent exercises, problems, specific instructions, or open questions.

Theorems are a special case of [tasks](#245-tasks).

By and large, tasks should be expressed as complex statements consisting of a sequence of:
1. "[Definitions]"
2. "[Variable-declarations]"
3. "[Task-declaration]"
4. "[Solution]"

This structure is mirrored from theorems. Therefore, all the rules for theorems apply here as well.

Certain tasks require an imperative command to be present in the statement. In this case, the imperative command should be placed at the beginning of the "[Task-declaration]" statement and should be as short as possible. This may include, but is not limited to:
- "Solve [Equation]"
- "Find [Variable]: [Expression]"

If a task doesn't contain a solution and the context doesn't imply that one should be present, then the internal statement of the details section of "[Solution]" should be left empty.

## 1.5. Examples

The good examples comply with the style guidelines. Use them as a reference and for derivation of additional implicit guidelines and rules, if necessary.

### 1.5.1. Example. Definition of complex numbers

#### Good example

These definitions are compact and declarative.

Each statement uses a few words at the beginning and a MathJax block expression at the end.

The first MathJax block is the definition of the imaginary unit $ i $.

The second MathJax block is a definition of complex numbers. It uses set builder notation to declare the set of complex numbers and their representation.

The third MathJax block defines the operations of addition and multiplication of complex numbers.

```markdown

### Complex numbers

The imaginary unit $ i $ satisfies:
$$ i^2 = -1 $$

$ \mathbb{C} $ is the set of complex numbers:
$$ \mathbb{C} = \{ \alpha: \quad \exist! \ a_r, a_i \in \R, \quad \alpha = a_r + a_i \, i \} $$

$ \forall \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C} $:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha + \beta &= (a_r + b_r) + (a_i + b_i) \, i \\
\alpha \beta &= (a_r b_r - a_i b_i) + (a_r b_i + a_i b_r) \, i
\end{aligned}
$$

```

#### Bad example

This statement is not compact, not declarative, is too verbose, and contains excessive wording.

It does not follow the newline and spacing styles.

```markdown

### Prove that addition of complex numbers is distributive

Suppose that $\alpha,\beta,\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. Then $\lambda(\alpha+\beta) = \lambda\alpha +\lambda\beta$.

... (proof omitted) ...

```

### 1.5.2. Example. Distributivity of multiplication over addition of complex numbers

#### Bad example

This statement is not compact, not declarative, is too verbose, and contains excessive wording.

It does not follow the newline and spacing styles.

```markdown

### Prove that addition of complex numbers is distributive

Suppose that $\alpha,\beta,\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. Then $\lambda(\alpha+\beta) = \lambda\alpha +\lambda\beta$.

... (proof omitted) ...

```

#### Good example

The statements of this example are compact and declarative. They contain minimal plain text, relying primarily on math symbols.

This example includes a theorem declaration statement as well as a details section for the proof. The proof consists of one derivation statement.

A long line in the first MathJax block is split by a single newline so that the source code fits the screen.

A long line in the second MathJax block is split by double newlines so that both the rendered output and source code fit the screen. Alignment is used to make it more readable and interconnected across lines.

```markdown

### Distributivity of multiplication over addition of complex numbers

$$
\forall \alpha, \beta, \lambda \in \mathbb{C} \quad
\lambda  (\alpha + \beta) = \lambda \alpha + \lambda \beta
$$

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>

$$
\begin{aligned}

\lambda  (\alpha + \beta) &= (l_r + l_i \, i)((a_r + b_r) + (a_i + b_i) \, i) \\

&= (l_r(a_r + b_r) - l_i(a_i + b_i)) + (l_r(a_i + b_i) + l_i(a_r + b_r)) \, i \\

&= (l_r a_r - l_i a_i + l_r b_r - l_i b_i) + (l_r a_i + l_i a_r + l_r b_i + l_i b_r) \, i \\

&= (l_r a_r - l_i a_i) + (l_r b_r - l_i b_i) + (l_r a_i + l_i a_r) \, i + (l_r b_i + l_i b_r) \, i \\

&= ((l_r a_r - l_i a_i) + (l_r a_i + l_i a_r) \, i) + ((l_r b_r - l_i b_i) + (l_r b_i + l_i b_r) \, i) \\

&= \lambda \alpha + \lambda \beta

\end{aligned}

### 1.5.3. Example. Square root of $ i $

#### Bad example

```markdown

### Find square roots of $ i $

Find distinct square roots of $ i $.

... (solution omitted) ...

```

#### Good example

The entire statement represents a single task statement with declaration and solution.

The solution in the details section is composed of a sequence of derivation statements, one naturally following from the other.

The last statement is a verification of the solution, which may be considered an evolved derivation, connecting the solution with the original task.

```markdown

### Square roots of $ i $

Solve for $ \alpha \in \mathbb{C} $:
$$ \alpha^2 = i $$

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a_r + a_i \, i)^2 &= i \\
a_r^2 - a_i^2 + 2 a_r a_i \, i &= i
\end{aligned}
$$

One complex number equation leads to two real number equations:
$$
a_r^2 - a_i^2 = 0 \\
2 a_r a_i \, i = i
$$

From the first equation follows:
$$ |a_r| = |a_i| $$

The second one leads to:
$$
a_r a_i > 0 \\
2 |a_r| |a_i| = 1
$$

Thus,
$$ |a_r| = |a_i| = \frac{1}{\sqrt2} $$

And finally,
$$ a_r = a_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \quad \text{or} \quad a_r = a_i = - \frac{1}{\sqrt2} $$

The square roots of $ i $ are:
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i \quad \\
\text{or} \quad -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i
$$

Verifying:

$$
\begin{aligned}

\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i \right)^2 \\

&= \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \right)^2 + 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i \right)^2 \\

&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2} \, i - \frac{1}{2} \\

&= i

\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}

\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i \right)^2 \\

&= \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} \right)^2 + 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} \right) \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i \right)
+ \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} \, i \right)^2 \\

&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2} \, i - \frac{1}{2} \\

&= i

\end{aligned}
$$

</details>

```
